# Final Project: Credit Risk Model

This repository contains my **final project** for the course **Introduction to Supervised Learning (CSCA 5622)**.  
The project focuses on building a **Credit Risk Model** using supervised machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of loan default based on customer and loan data. The workflow includes:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding the dataset  
   - Visualizing distributions and relationships  
   - Identifying missing values and outliers  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Scaling and normalization  

3. **Managing Imbalanced Classes**  
   - Techniques such as SMOTE, and using parameters for each type of model to overcome this

4. **Modeling**  
   - Training supervised machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
   - Hyperparameter tuning

5. **Results and Evaluation**  
   - Confusion matrix, AUC-ROC, precision, recall  
   - Analysis and interpretation of model features using Shap values
